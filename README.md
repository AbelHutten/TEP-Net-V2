# TEP-Net-V2
Experiments with [TEP-Net (Laurent 2024)](arxiv.org/abs/2403.13094), with the goal of improving performance through architectural enhancements.

A large part of the code in this work comes from the repository that is associated with the publication, [train-ego-path-detection](https://github.com/irtrailenium/train-ego-path-detection), as this work is a continuation of that work. Please star [train-ego-path-detection](https://github.com/irtrailenium/train-ego-path-detection), and cite the original paper from Thomas Laurent, if you find his work useful:

```bibtex

      eprint={2403.13094},

The changes I made to his code are my own, and are not associated with the authors or publishers of the original work.
